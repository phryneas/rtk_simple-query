## What this is:

This is an experiment to create a generic api client based on (and potentially to be shipped with) [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) that allows for effective querying of non-normalized api endpoints with some global caching & cache invalidation mechanisms.

## Getting it / trying it out

For now, look at [The CodeSandbox CI](https://ci.codesandbox.io/status/rtk-incubator/rtk-query/pr/1) for the latest experimental package builds and up-to-date example sandboxes.

Then follow along with the [Quick Start](https://rtk-query-docs.netlify.app/introduction/quick-start) - make sure to use the latest CodeSandbox build when installing :)

```sh title="Example installation"
yarn add https://pkg.csb.dev/rtk-incubator/rtk-query/commit/0271589e/@rtk-incubator/rtk-query

```

## Documentation

**_Note: this is being updated frequently as we're in alpha_**

The working documentation can be [viewed here](https://rtk-query-docs.netlify.app/). In addition, you can check out the generated deploy previews on any PR before things land in `main`.
