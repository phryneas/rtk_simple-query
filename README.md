What this is:

This is an experiment to create a generic api client based on (and potentially to be shipped with) redux toolkit that allows for effective querying of non-normalized api endpoints with some global caching & cache invalidation mechanisms.

TODOS:

- [x] create a PR against RTK that adds .requestId to the returned promise
- [x] split up that monster file
- [ ] more useful tests
- [ ] think about invalidation after all subscribers for a query have unsubscibed (+60 seconds or so)
- [ ] basic invalidation: when a mutation invalidates an entity type, refetch all queries that provided that type
- [ ] advanced invalidation: differentiate between mutations invalidating all entities of a type or single entities vs queries providing a single entity/a number of unspecified entities
- [ ] hooks should return a promise (requires RTK patch from above)
- [ ] add a condition that prevents a query from re-running when a second component subscribes to the same query with the same arguments
- [ ] return a refetch function from useQuery that does said refetch
- [ ] implement a skip option for useQuery to prevent fetching on initial render

Remove this.
